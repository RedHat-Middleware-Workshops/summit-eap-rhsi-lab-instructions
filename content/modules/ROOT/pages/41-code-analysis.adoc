= Code Analysis

JBoss EAP 8.0 requires code changes to applications written for JBoss EAP 7.4. Due to the move from Jakarta 8 to Jakarta 10 (e.g. converting from the “javax” namespace to “jakarta” namespace). These changes are documented in this https://access.redhat.com/articles/6980265[article, window="_blank"].

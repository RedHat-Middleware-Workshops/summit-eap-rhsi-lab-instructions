= Access Your Development Environment

You will be using Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces, a browser-based IDE. **Changes to files are auto-saved every few seconds**, so you don't need to explicitly save changes.

== 1. Logging into OpenShift Dev Spaces.

To get started, {devspaces_url}[access the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces^] you will be presented with an option to login with your OpenShift credentials

NOTE: Users of Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code will see a familiar layout: a project/file browser on the left, a code editor on the right, and a terminal at the bottom. You'll use all of these during the course of this workshop, so keep this browser tab open throughout. **If things get weird, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.**

== 2. Running terminal commands

Throughout this workshop you will be running commands in the integrated terminal. 

include::partial$open-terminal.adoc[]

== 3. Create lab project 

IMPORTANT: Throughout this lab we will be using a project called {USER_ID}-project.  You will need to create this project if you have not already done so.

. Enter the following from the terminal:
+
[source,sh,role="copypaste",subs=attributes+]
----
oc new-project {USER_ID}-project
----
+
You will see a response similar to
+
[source,sh,subs=attributes+]
----
Now using project "{USER_ID}-project" on server "https://172.30.0.1:443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example

to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/serve_hostname
----

== 4. Configuring GIT

We will be pushing code changes to a git repository we have provisioned for each user.  

IMPORTANT: Before pushing to git you will need to set your git email and name.  

. From the integrated terminal, enter the following commands.

[source,sh,role="copypaste",subs=attributes+]
----
 git config --global user.email "{USER_ID}@example.com"
 git config --global user.name "{USER_ID}"
----

Ready? Let's go!

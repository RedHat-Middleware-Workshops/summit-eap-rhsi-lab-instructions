= OpenShift Environment

Red Hat have developed a lot of tools to provision Red Hat Application services and dependencies on OpenShift.  These tools include:

* JBoss EAP Helm chart to configure and build JBoss EAP applications for OpenShift
* JBoss EAP Operator to deploy JBoss EAP applications on OpenShift
* AMQ Broker Operator to deploy and configure AMQ Broker instances and topics on OpenShift
* Red Hat Build of Keycloak Operator to deploy and configure Red Hat Build of Keycloak instances on OpenShift

In this lab, we're going to use these tools to simplify the deployment of our application on OpenShift.

== Red Hat Build of Keycloak configuration

We've already deployed an instance of Red Hat Build of Keycloak using the Red Hat Build of Keycloak operator, this is configured and ready to use. Before we deploy the application to OpenShift we need to verify the Red Hat Build of Keycloak configuration and push our changes to our individual gitea account.

*Step 3.1:* In the IDE, open the file: coolstore/src/main/webapp/keycloak.json and ensure the contents are as follows:

[source,json,role="copypaste"]
----
{
  "realm": "eap",
  "auth-server-url": "https://rhbk-rhbk.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}/",
  "ssl-required": "external",
  "resource": "eap-app",
  "public-client": true,
  "confidential-port": 0
}
----

*Step 3.2:* Click on the "Source Control" icon in the IDE, you should see the following:

Enter a commit message in the message field and click on the "Commit" button.

*Step 3.2:* You will be prompted to stage files to the commit

image::git-2.png[stage-files]

Click on "Yes" and then click on "Sync Changes" to push your changes to gitea

*Step 3.3:* You will be prompted to enter a username:

image::git-3.png[git-username]

Enter `{{ USER_ID }}`

*Step 3.4:* You will then be prompted for a password:

Enter `{{ CHE_USER_PASSWORD }}`

Your changes will be pushed to gitea.

## Deploying on OpenShift

*Step 3.5:* Access the OpenShift console by clicking on the following {{ CONSOLE_URL }}[link^] 

Login with the following credentials:

* *Username*: `{{ USER_ID }}`
* *Password*: `{{ CHE_USER_PASSWORD }}`

*Step 3.6: Switch to the project called "{{ USER_ID }}-project"*

## Create a secret for the PostgreSQL database

*Step 3.7:* Within this project, add a PostgreSQL secret by running the following from the terminal

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc create secret generic postgresql --from-literal database-password=postgresPW --from-literal database-user=postgresUser -n {{ USER_ID }}-project 
----

## Deploy an AMQ broker instance

Our application will require an external message queue.  We'll use the AMQ Broker operator to deploy and configure an AMQ broker instance

*Step 3.10:* Click on "+Add" and select "Operator Backed"

From the list below, select "ActiveMQ Artemis"

image::operator-backed.png[operator-backed,80%]

*Step 3.11:* From the next screen, click on "Create" and then paste the following YAML into the "YAML view" editor

[source,yaml,role="copypaste"]
----
apiVersion: broker.amq.io/v1beta1
kind: ActiveMQArtemis
metadata:
  name: eap74-amq7
spec:
  acceptors:
    - name: my-acceptor
      port: 61616
      protocols: 'core'
  deploymentPlan:
    image: placeholder
    jolokiaAgentEnabled: false
    journalType: nio
    managementRBACEnabled: true
    messageMigration: false
    persistenceEnabled: false
    requireLogin: false
    size: 2
  console:
    expose: true
----

Next, we're going to create an "AMQ Artemis Address"

*Step 3.12:* Click on "+Add" again, select "Operator Backed" and then choose "AMQ Artemis Address"

*Step 3.13:* From the next screen, click on "Create" and then paste the following YAML into the "YAML view" editor

[source,yaml,role="copypaste"]
----
apiVersion: broker.amq.io/v1beta1
kind: ActiveMQArtemisAddress
metadata:
  name: artemis-address-topic
spec:
  addressName: topic.orders
  queueName: topic/orders
  routingType: multicast
----

This config map contains non-sensitive information relating to the PostgreSQL connection and AMQ broker connection such as the database service host and database name, the AMQ broker service host and topic names.  Sensitive information such as username / password will be pulled from the secrets created when these services where deployed.

*Step 3.16:* To create the config map, click on "ConfigMaps" on the left menu and click on "Create ConfigMap".  From the "Create ConfigMap" page, select "YAML view" and paste the following text:

[source,yaml,role="copypaste"]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: eap-config
data: 
  # Configuration to connnect to PostgreSQL
  POSTGRESQL_DATABASE: postgresDB
  POSTGRESQL_DATASOURCE: CoolstoreDS
  POSTGRESQL_SERVICE_HOST: postgresql
  # Configuration to connect to AMQ Broker
  MQ_SERVICE_PREFIX_MAPPING: eap74-amq7=MQ
  EAP74_AMQ_TCP_SERVICE_HOST: eap74-amq7-hdls-svc
  EAP74_AMQ_TCP_SERVICE_PORT: "61616"
  MQ_TOPICS: orders
  AMQ_JNDI: java:/eap74-amq7/ConnectionFactory
----


We can now move on to the deployment of our JBoss EAP 8.0 application to OpenShift.

Using project "{USER_ID}-project" on server

. Since we'll be using multiple terminal sessions in this exercise (one for OpenShift and other for the VM). Let's split the terminal into two windows

. Login to the VM using this newly created terminal tab+

[source,sh,role="copypaste",subs=attributes+]
----
ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=60 {bastion_ssh_user_name}@{bastion_public_hostname}
----

. Enter the following password to login
+
*Password:* `{bastion_ssh_password}`

. If the login has been successful you should be logged in as `lab-user` on the VM

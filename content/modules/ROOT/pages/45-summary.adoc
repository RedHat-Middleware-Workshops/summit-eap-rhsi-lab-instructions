== Summary

In this lab we've taken a JBoss EAP 7.4 application and migrated it to JBoss EAP 8.0 using the Migration Toolkit for Runtimes.  We've then built the application on OpenShift by adding the JBoss EAP Maven plugin to the maven configuration and using the EAP8.0 Helm chart in OpenShift. Finally we've used the EAP Operator to deploy the application image.

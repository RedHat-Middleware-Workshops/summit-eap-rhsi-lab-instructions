== Workshop summary

In this workshop we've completed the migration of a JBoss EAP 7.4 application to JBoss EAP 8.0.  We've then deployed this application on OpenShift.
We've use Red Hat Service Interconnect to create a connection between a PostgreSQL database service running on a virtual machine and an OpenShift namespace.

The resulting architecture should resemble our desired end-state:
